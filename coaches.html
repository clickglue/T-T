<h2>Ilse Denruyter</h2>
<p>
    I’m a Business & Change Advisor, Leadership & Career Coach, Ambassador of ICF Belgium, and the owner of Human Centric Solutions. With over 20 years in the corporate world, including 15 years in leadership roles, I’ve developed a deep understanding of the challenges organizations face. For the past 7 years, I’ve dedicated myself to coaching and change management, helping individuals and teams unlock their potential and achieve sustainable growth.
    My coaching philosophy is grounded in my background as a former top-level track and field athlete, where dedication, resilience, and perseverance were key to my success. These qualities shape my approach today, as I work with clients to build meaningful careers and lead balanced, fulfilling lives.
    Recently, I’m finishing a bachelor’s degree in psychology, allowing me to combine scientific knowledge with practical experience.
    My mission is to inspire and guide others toward personal and professional balance, with a strong focus on their unique talents and ambitions.
