      <h2>Who is it for?</h2>
      <p>
        We live in a demanding world. We want to work hard, be good parents,
        maintain relationships, discover new parts of the world. Often we are
        pushed to the boundaries of our mental and physical capabilities.
        Sometimes we run the risk of going over these limits, loosing our
        balance. Then we find ourselves in a situation where we need a long time
        detached from everything to regain our enthousiasm and motivation. This
        comes at great cost for you as individual, your environment and the
        employer. Nobody should take this risk. <br />
        If you this program might help you to maintain your personal
        sustainability, please talk to HR!
