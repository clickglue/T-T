        <h2>Estimating the cost of long term absence</h2>
        <p>Direct Costs <br> Continued Salary Payments: <br> 
            During the initial period of sick leave, the employer may continue to pay the salary. This duration and amount can vary
            depending on company policy and local labor laws. <br> Medical and Healthcare Costs:
            If the company offers health insurance that covers mental health services, they
            might bear higher premiums or specific costs related to the employee's treatment
            for burnout. <br> Indirect Costs Replacement Costs: <br> Hiring a temporary worker or
            paying overtime to other employees to cover the duties of the absentee can be
            costly. <br> Lost Productivity: <br> The absent employee's work either slows down or must
            be redistributed among other team members, which can reduce overall
            productivity. <br> Decreased Morale: <br> The absence of a team member might affect the
            morale of the team, potentially reducing productivity further and increasing the
            risk of more health-related absences among other employees. <br> Administrative
            Costs: <br> Managing the absence, including adjustments to project timelines or
            redistributing responsibilities, involves administrative time and effort. <br>
            Reintegration Costs Gradual Return to Work: When the employee returns, they
            might start with reduced hours or lighter duties, which can extend the period of
            reduced productivity. <br> Support and Accommodation: Additional resources might be
            required to support the returning employee, such as counseling or changes to
            their work environment to prevent future burnout. <br><br> Example Calculation Let's
            assume an employee earns an annual salary of €30,000, and the company supports
            their salary fully during a six-month absence. The direct cost in terms of
            salary would be about €15,000. Adding potential increased healthcare costs,
            let’s say €500. For indirect costs, if we assume the productivity loss and the
            cost of hiring temporary help or overtime pay equals an additional 20% of their
            salary over this period, that would add another €3,000. Total Estimated Cost:
            Direct Costs: €15,500 (salary and increased healthcare costs) Indirect Costs:
            €3,000 (productivity loss, replacement costs) Total: €18,500 This estimate is
            simplistic and would vary significantly based on specific circumstances, such as
            the employee's role, the impact on ongoing projects, and the company's policies
            on handling long-term absences. Additionally, investing in preventive measures
            and a supportive work environment can reduce these costs significantly by
            lowering the incidence of burnout.</p>
